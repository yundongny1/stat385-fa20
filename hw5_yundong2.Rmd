## Homework 5
### Due: Monday November 9, 2020 11:59 pm US Central Time
#### Created by Christopher Kinson

Grading Rubric (per question):  
2 points if complete and correct  
1 point if incomplete or incorrect  
0 points if no attempt made  


**Retrieving your work**

This and all future homework files are written in RMarkdown (.Rmd). The .Rmd file will exist in the `homework` directory within the `course-materials` repo, i.e. `course-materials/homework` in GitHub. You must **pull** the `course-materials` repo first to ensure that you have the most updated version of all course materials and files. After pulling the repo, the homework file will be in the homework directory. You must save the homework file into your individual GitHub repo (the one named as your netID). 

**Submitting your work**

In your individual repo (the one named as your netID), you are to submit ***two*** files:

a. Your reproducible document file (.Rmd) which should be saved as hw#_netID.Rmd. For example, my homework 1 file would be saved as hw1_kinson2.Rmd.

b. Your rendered reproducible document file (.html) which should be saved as hw#_netID.html. For example, my homework 1 file would be saved as hw1_kinson2.html.

You have an unlimited number of submissions, but only the latest proper submission (commit and push) will be viewed and graded. Remember the .Rmd file needs to render properly to .html before submitting.

*The following problems should be completed by you as an individual. If any problem asks you a particular question, be sure to answer it completely (with code, written sentences, or both). Written sentences should not appear in code chunks or code cells. Written sentences should appear in Markdown syntax unless specifically stated otherwise. When students get stuck on a homework problem, students should ask the question in the Issues page in GitHub. Do not change anything in this file above the double line.*

### Use R for this entire homework assignment. Use the provided URLs to access the datasets (if any). Functions or programming ideas outside of the topics/ideas covered thus far are not allowed. The `subset` function is never allowed in this course.

**#1** (Markdown) Using Markdown syntax, make a numbered list with your first name in normal text as the first item and your last name in italic text as the second item. 

  1. Justin
  2. *Kim*


**#2** (Personal interest survey) How did you feel about the midterm? What was the hardest part of the midterm? What was the easiest part of the midterm?


  I think number 9 was difficult and had to resort to brute force method instead of writing a function to do the work for me. Number 20 was also difficult and I still am unsure how the function works.


**#3** (RMarkdown, R Objects, their modes, and attributes, R Lists and data frames, What is data, Importing data) Using tidyverse functionality, import the US State-level COVID-19 Historical Data from the New York Times and the Harvard's 2016 US Presidential Election by State Data using R and the data URLs [covid](https://uofi.box.com/shared/static/urzam55r2uyrzxwz34gf3i2jujviqbma.csv) and [election](https://uofi.box.com/shared/static/rsvhhskt1eb2q18od1wjscgs6646g93t.csv). 

Now, print the structure (or mode of each column) for each dataset. 

```{r}

covid = read.csv("https://uofi.box.com/shared/static/urzam55r2uyrzxwz34gf3i2jujviqbma.csv")
election = read.csv("https://uofi.box.com/shared/static/rsvhhskt1eb2q18od1wjscgs6646g93t.csv")

str(covid)
```


- Data information: The **covid** dataset (a .csv file) contains the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths per state as a time series. The **election** data (a .csv file) contains how each state voted in the 2016 US Presidential Election and the number of votes each candidate received along with their political party affiliations. The candidate receiving the most votes can be considered as the winner of that state along with their political party. In other words, the state's political party affiliation is based on the candidate who who received the most votes for that state.


**#4** (RMarkdown, R Objects, their modes, and attributes, R Simple manipulations and Numbers and vectors, Object arrangement, R Arrays and matrices, R Lists and data frames, R Grouping, loops, and conditional execution, Apply family of functions, Vectorization, Data wrangling with the tidyverse) Beginning with the **election** data in **Problem #3**, do the following:

i. rename the totalvotes column as "quasi_pop" using tidyverse functionality

ii. remove the columns that contain the year, version, and notes in the **election** data using tidyverse functionality

Print the first 10 rows of the **election** data.

```{r}
election$quasi_pop <- election$totalvotes
names(election)

election <- election[,-c(1,12,13)]
head(election,10)

```



**#5** (RMarkdown, R Objects, their modes, and attributes, R Simple manipulations and Numbers and vectors, Object arrangement, R Arrays and matrices, R Lists and data frames, R Grouping, loops, and conditional execution, Apply family of functions, Vectorization, Data wrangling with the tidyverse) Using tidyverse functionality, combine the imported **covid** data (**Problem #3**) with the modified **election** data (**Problem #4**) using an inner join such that there is only one candidate (the one who received the most votes) for each state and only states that are common to both datasets are stored in the combined data. 

Now, print the first 10 observations of the combined data. *Hint: Keep in mind that this inner join will only make sense for the most recent date of COVID-19 data.*
```{r}
##covid2 the most recent covid data
covid2 <- covid[covid$date=="2020-10-01",]
covid2
states = unique(election$state)


election2 = NULL


for(i in 1:length(states)){
  maxvotes = max(election[election$state==states[i],"candidatevotes"])
  election2 = rbind(election2,election[election$candidatevotes==maxvotes, ])
}
combined = merge(covid2, election2, by = "state")  
head(combined, 10)
combined <- merge(covid2, election2, by="state")
head(combined, 10)

```



**#6** (RMarkdown, R Objects, their modes, and attributes, R Simple manipulations and Numbers and vectors, Object arrangement, R Arrays and matrices, R Lists and data frames, R Grouping, loops, and conditional execution, Apply family of functions, Vectorization, Data wrangling with the tidyverse) Beginning with the combined data in **Problem #5**, answer the following question: How many states who voted republican in the election are in the top 10 for the largest number of cases from COVID-19 (at its most recent date)? *Your question should be answered in bold words in Markdown, and the resulting code using tidyverse functionality and data print out should serve as evidence.*

```{r}
names(combined)
combined[order(combined$cases, decreasing = TRUE),][c(1,12,4)]
```


**There are 6 republican states who are in the top 10 for number of cases for COVID19**

**#7** (RMarkdown, R Objects, their modes, and attributes, R Simple manipulations and Numbers and vectors, Object arrangement, R Arrays and matrices, R Lists and data frames, R Grouping, loops, and conditional execution, Apply family of functions, Vectorization, Data wrangling with the tidyverse) Beginning with the combined data in **Problem #5**, answer the following question: Does dividing the number of cases by the "quasi_pop" alter which republican states are in the top 10 for the largest number of cases from COVID-19 (at its most recent date)? *Your question should be answered in bold words in Markdown, and the resulting code using tidyverse functionality and data print out should serve as evidence.* 

```{r}
combined$caserates = (combined$cases)/(combined$quasi_pop)
combined[order(combined$caserates, decreasing = TRUE),][c(1,12,17)]
```


**Dividing cases by quasi pop does alter which states are in the top 10 for the largest number of cases from COVID. There are now 9 states who voted republican that are in the top 10 for covid19 cases per votes.**

**#8** (RMarkdown, R Objects, their modes, and attributes, R Lists and data frames, What is data, Importing data) Import a Champaign County Sheriff Office & Jail Dataset (this dataset includes information during January 01, 2019 - July 31, 2020) using tidyverse functionality and the data URL https://uofi.box.com/shared/static/lbah1aw0cwghyrelzur0tk3akh65tin6.txt. Now, print the descriptor portion.  *Ensure that the 2 date columns and 2 time columns are properly formatted (as numeric modes) before moving onto Problem #9.*

The dataset (a .txt file) contains over 15418 observations and 38 columns for individuals who were booked into jail in Champaign County. The individuals are not identifiable based on personal identity, but they are given unique jacket numbers. Some rows in the data appear more than once because of multiple crimes being assigned to one person. But there is also the possibility of there being recidivists. A recidivist is a person who goes to jail repeatedly (more than one datetime). The demographics of the people, reasons for being booked, and crime code are also given in the data. The original source is the Champaign County Sheriff Office & Jail (CCSO).

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
crime = read_delim("C:/Users/Justin/Desktop/jail.txt", delim="|t")
crime
crime$booking_date <- as.Date(crime$booking_date, "%m/%d/%Y")
crime$released_date <- as.Date(crime$released_date, "%m/%d/%Y")
crime

crime$jail_start = as.POSIXct(paste(crime$booking_date, crime$booking_time), format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
crime$jail_end = as.POSIXct(paste(crime$released_date, crime$released_time), format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
crime

df = data.frame(crime)
df





```



**#9** (RMarkdown, R Objects, their modes, and attributes, R Simple manipulations and Numbers and vectors, Object arrangement, R Arrays and matrices, R Lists and data frames, R Grouping, loops, and conditional execution, Apply family of functions, Vectorization, Data wrangling with the tidyverse) Using the imported data in **Problem #8**, do the following: 

i. use the Booking Date and Time and Release Date and Time columns to create (with tidyverse functionality) one single column representing the duration of time (in hours) called "time_spent_in_jail". *Hint: Look up the help documentation on the `difftime()` function.*  

ii. sort (with tidyverse functionality) the data by time_spent_in_jail in descending order

Now, print the first 10 observations of the sorted data.

```{r}
help(difftime)

df["time_spent_in_jail"] = difftime(df$jail_end,df$jail_start,units= 'hours')

df2 = arrange(df,desc(time_spent_in_jail))
head(df2[38:41], 10)
```


**#10** (RMarkdown, R Objects, their modes, and attributes, R Simple manipulations and Numbers and vectors, Object arrangement, R Arrays and matrices, R Lists and data frames, R Grouping, loops, and conditional execution, Apply family of functions, Vectorization, Data wrangling with the tidyverse) Danville, Champaign, and Urbana are just three cities in East Central Illinois. Using the imported data in **Problem #8** and tidyverse functionality, create a new subset dataset called "dcu" that contains any person booked into jail who resides in these three cities. *In this problem, you should make sure the three cities are correctly spelled. There are several mispellings in the data. Again, tidyverse functionality must be used. Do not remove duplicates in this problem.*

Now, print the first 5 and the last 5 observations of "dcu" but only showing the following: jacket number, age at arrest, city, state, sex.

```{r}


```
